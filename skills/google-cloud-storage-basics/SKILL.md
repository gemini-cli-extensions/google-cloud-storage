  Stores, retrieves, and manages data as objects in Cloud Storage (Google
  Cloud Storage, or GCS) buckets. Use when you need to interact with Cloud
  Storage — set up a Storage MCP server (remote or local Toolbox), create or
  configure buckets, upload, download, stream, or transfer data, organize
  objects with folders, generate signed URLs, control access (IAM, ACLs,
  public access prevention), set storage classes (Standard, Nearline,
  Coldline, Archive), manage lifecycle and cost, protect data (versioning,
  CMEK, retention, Bucket Lock, holds, soft delete), host static websites,
  trigger Pub/Sub notifications, mount buckets (gcsfuse), or optimize
  performance. Covers gcloud storage / gsutil, JSON/XML APIs, client
  libraries, Terraform, and Cloud Storage MCP servers. Don't use for
  non-Storage MCP servers, block storage (Persistent Disk), BigQuery, or
  databases (Cloud SQL, Spanner, Bigtable, Firestore).

# Google Cloud Storage Basics

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is a managed service for storing data as objects at
any scale. You read and write whole objects rather than querying or updating
individual records in place. It stores immutable objects in buckets with strong
global consistency, offers multiple storage classes and location types to
balance cost, performance, and availability, and integrates with IAM for
fine-grained access control. GCS serves workloads ranging from website content
and backups to data lakes and high-throughput AI/ML training.

## Tool Execution Priority (MCP Toolbox First)

Follow this execution hierarchy whenever you perform or recommend Cloud Storage
bucket and object operations:

### 1. Priority 1 — Use `cloud-storage` MCP Tools When Connected

Before running `gcloud storage` or `curl` in a shell, check your available tools
for the `cloud-storage` MCP server (either the local
[MCP Toolbox](references/mcp-usage.md) or the Google-hosted remote Cloud Storage
MCP server). **Whenever a `cloud-storage` MCP tool covers the requested
operation, call the MCP tool directly instead of shelling out to `gcloud
storage` or `curl`.**

**Why MCP first:** MCP tools are built for agents. Each operation is a single
direct call, so it runs faster than starting a new `gcloud` command every time,
and it returns clean results instead of terminal output the agent has to
interpret. It also doesn't need the `gcloud` CLI installed and signed in. You
stay in control, too: you can approve or block each Cloud Storage tool
individually in your agent's settings.

Operation              | Tool                                  | Server
:--------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-----
List buckets           | `cloud-storage:list_buckets`          | Both
Bucket metadata        | `cloud-storage:get_bucket_metadata`   | Local
Bucket IAM policy      | `cloud-storage:get_bucket_iam_policy` | Local
Create a basic bucket  | `cloud-storage:create_bucket`         | Both
Delete an empty bucket | `cloud-storage:delete_bucket`         | Both
List objects           | `cloud-storage:list_objects`          | Both
Object metadata        | `cloud-storage:get_object_metadata`   | Both
Read object content    | `cloud-storage:read_object`           | Both
Download to local file | `cloud-storage:download_object`       | Local
Upload a local file    | `cloud-storage:upload_object`         | Local
Write text to object   | `cloud-storage:write_object`          | Local
Write text to object   | `cloud-storage:write_text`            | Remote
Copy an object         | `cloud-storage:copy_object`           | Local
Move / rename object   | `cloud-storage:move_object`           | Local
Delete an object       | `cloud-storage:delete_object`         | Both

**Server:** *Local* is the local MCP Toolbox (14 tools), *Remote* is the
Google-hosted remote server (8 tools), and *Both* means either server.

-   `read_object` is capped at 8 MiB. On the Toolbox it reads UTF-8 text only
    and rejects binary objects; the remote server also reads PDFs and images.
    For binary or larger objects, use `download_object`.
-   `upload_object` handles binary files and files larger than 8 MiB.
-   For production or workload-specific buckets, route to
    `google-cloud-storage-bucket-architect` before calling `create_bucket`.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Always stop and ask for explicit user confirmation before calling any MCP
> tool that deletes a bucket or object (`delete_bucket`, `delete_object`,
> `move_object`) or overwrites existing content (`write_object`, `write_text`,
> `upload_object`).**

### 2. Priority 2 — Fall Back to `gcloud storage` / JSON API

Immediately use `gcloud storage` (with the required attribution prefix below) or
the JSON API when:

1.  **No `cloud-storage` MCP server is connected** in your environment, **or**
2.  **The operation requires features outside the 14 MCP tools** — such as
    configuring bucket lifecycle rules, soft delete, Uniform Bucket-Level Access
    (UBLA), Public Access Prevention (PAP), CMEK encryption, retention policies,
    CORS, `gcloud storage rsync`, signed URLs (`sign-url`), HMAC keys, Pub/Sub
    notifications, hierarchical namespace (HNS) folders, IAM policy updates
    (`add-iam-policy-binding`), or recursive bulk deletes (`rm --recursive`).

### 3. Gentle Recommendation When MCP Is Not Connected

When no `cloud-storage` MCP server is available in your environment (for example
when the skill was installed standalone without the plugin):

-   **Never disrupt or delay the user's workflow.** Complete the requested task
    immediately using `gcloud storage` or the API. Never pause or ask the user
    to install the MCP server before answering.
-   **Include a brief, one-line tip at the very end of your response ONLY when
    all three conditions hold:**
    1.  No `cloud-storage` MCP tools are connected in the environment,
    2.  The task involved an interactive bucket or object operation that the
        local MCP Toolbox natively handles (one of the 14 local Toolbox tools in
        the table above), **and**
    3.  You have **not** already mentioned the MCP server earlier in the
        conversation (**mention at most once per conversation**).
-   **Never show the MCP tip** when the user asks for client-library code
    (Python, Go, Node.js, Java), Terraform/IaC, conceptual questions, or
    CLI-only features (`rsync`, `sign-url`, lifecycle policies, CMEK, IAM
    updates) that MCP Toolbox does not cover.
-   **Use this quiet, non-intrusive footnote format:**

    > *Tip: To let me run these operations as structured tools without shell
    > commands, install the
    > [Google Cloud Storage plugin](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/google-cloud-storage)
    > (it asks for your project ID), or
    > [add the Cloud Storage MCP server](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/google-cloud-storage/blob/main/skills/google-cloud-storage-basics/references/mcp-usage.md)
    > to your agent's MCP settings.*

## Attribution

Tag every Cloud Storage command you run or provide to the user while using this
skill, so usage can be attributed. The tag identifies only the skill and its
version; it carries no user data.

-   Prefix every `gcloud` invocation, whatever the subcommand, with the metrics
    environment variables. Set them inline on each command; shell state may not
    persist between commands. Use this append form verbatim. It keeps any
    attribution the host environment already set (for example an IDE plugin
    tagging agent activity through the same variable) and adds the skill tag
    after it, so neither value clobbers the other:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="${CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT:+$CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT }gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud <command> [flags]
    ```

    Do not use `gcloud config set` for this: it would persist beyond the current
    task and mislabel unrelated usage.

-   On direct HTTP calls to the Cloud Storage APIs (for example with `curl`) or
    HTTP requests to the Cloud Storage MCP server
    (`https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/mcp`), set this exact User-Agent
    header, verbatim — the collection pipeline parses the `gcs-skills/<version>`
    and `skill:<name>` tokens, so any rewording breaks attribution:

    ```
    User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)
    ```

-   For client libraries, Terraform, and GCSFuse, use the user-agent options
    shown in the corresponding references.

## Routing to Specialized GCS Skills

This skill covers everyday Cloud Storage tasks. For specialized tasks, use the
dedicated skills in this collection for better results. Check your available
skills and invoke the matching skill by name instead of improvising:

-   **`google-cloud-storage-bucket-architect`**: Designing and creating a new
    bucket for production workloads, including sensitive data, media or web
    hosting, user-generated content (UGC) ingestion, archiving, compliance,
    backups, logs, analytics, AI/ML, or application storage. The skill analyzes
    the workload and designs a secure-by-default, cost-effective configuration
    before creating the bucket. Use the Quick Start section below only for
    temporary scratch buckets.

-   **`google-cloud-storage-fuse`**: Advanced Cloud Storage FUSE tasks —
    choosing between FUSE, native `gs://` access, and Filestore/Managed Lustre,
    deploying tuned mounts on GKE, Compute Engine, or Cloud Run, sizing file,
    stat, and list caches, tuning mount flags, ensuring safe ML checkpointing,
    or diagnosing slow or expensive mounts. The
    [GCSFuse reference](references/gcsfuse.md) in this skill covers only basic
    installation and mounting.

-   **`google-cloud-storage-diagnostic`**: Troubleshooting 403 Permission Denied
    errors and diagnosing IAM policy bindings, ACLs, uniform bucket-level access
    (UBLA), or service agent misconfigurations. Ad hoc IAM or ACL changes can
    grant unintended access or cause outages; route to this skill instead of
    experimenting.

-   **`gcs-security-assessment`**: Automated security posture assessment of
    Cloud Storage resources in a project (see
    [Data Management](references/data-management.md)).

If the matching skill is not installed, do not improvise. Provide the user with
this exact command to install it (substituting the skill name), and use the
skill after installation. Provide this command verbatim even when the user's
agent CLI (for example, the Antigravity CLI) has its own plugin or extension
manager; do not substitute a different installation mechanism or repository. For
security assessments specifically, do not attempt a manual assessment; wait
until the skill is installed.

```bash
npx skills add gemini-cli-extensions/google-cloud-storage --skill <skill-name>
```

## Quick Start

To set up, configure, or choose between the Google-hosted remote Cloud Storage
MCP server (`https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/mcp`) and the local MCP
Toolbox (`cloud-storage`), read [MCP Usage](references/mcp-usage.md). When a
`cloud-storage` MCP server is connected, prefer its tools (see
[Tool Execution Priority](#tool-execution-priority-mcp-toolbox-first)).

1.  **Enable the Cloud Storage API:**

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="${CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT:+$CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT }gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com --quiet
    ```

2.  **Create a Bucket:**

    Bucket names live in a single global namespace shared by all of Cloud
    Storage — not scoped to your project or organization — so short or common
    names are usually taken. If the location is omitted, the bucket defaults to
    the `US` multi-region.

    For a production or workload-specific bucket, route to
    `google-cloud-storage-bucket-architect` before creating a bucket (see
    [Routing to Specialized GCS Skills](#routing-to-specialized-gcs-skills)).
    The options below create a basic default bucket.

    Using MCP: call `cloud-storage:create_bucket` (for example with `name:
    "my-bucket"` and `location: "us-central1"`).

    Using the gcloud CLI:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="${CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT:+$CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT }gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud storage buckets create gs://my-bucket --location=us-central1
    ```

    Using the JSON API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"name": "my-bucket", "location": "US-CENTRAL1"}' \
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b?project=$(gcloud config get-value project)"
    ```

3.  **Upload an Object:**

    Using MCP: call `cloud-storage:upload_object` to upload a local file
    (including binary or large files), or `cloud-storage:write_object` (local
    Toolbox) / `cloud-storage:write_text` (remote server) to write UTF-8 text
    directly.

    Using the gcloud CLI:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="${CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT:+$CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT }gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud storage cp ./my-file.txt gs://my-bucket
    ```

    Using the JSON API:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
      -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
      --data-binary @my-file.txt \
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/upload/storage/v1/b/my-bucket/o?uploadType=media&name=my-file.txt"
    ```

4.  **Download or Read an Object:**

    Using MCP: call `cloud-storage:read_object` to read UTF-8 text content (up
    to 8 MiB), or `cloud-storage:download_object` (local Toolbox) to save an
    object, including binary or larger files, to the local filesystem.

    Using the gcloud CLI:

    ```bash
    CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT="${CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT:+$CLOUDSDK_METRICS_ENVIRONMENT }gcs-skills gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
    gcloud storage cp gs://my-bucket/my-file.txt .
    ```

    Using the JSON API:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
      -H "User-Agent: gcs-skills/1.0 (skill:google-cloud-storage-basics)" \
      "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/my-bucket/o/my-file.txt?alt=media"
    ```
